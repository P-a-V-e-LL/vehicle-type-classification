2022-02-21 19:33:13.564439: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:151] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  AVX2 AVX512F FMA
To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.

/mnt/nvme0n1/neuroweb/projects/vehicle-type-classification-2/env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_addons/utils/ensure_tf_install.py:67: UserWarning: Tensorflow Addons supports using Python ops for all Tensorflow versions above or equal to 2.4.0 and strictly below 2.7.0 (nightly versions are not supported). 
 The versions of TensorFlow you are currently using is 2.7.0 and is not supported. 
Some things might work, some things might not.
If you were to encounter a bug, do not file an issue.
If you want to make sure you're using a tested and supported configuration, either change the TensorFlow version or the TensorFlow Addons's version. 
You can find the compatibility matrix in TensorFlow Addon's readme:

  UserWarning,
WARNING:tensorflow:No training configuration found in the save file, so the model was *not* compiled. Compile it manually.
